##### This is a work in progess
		Here lies some of my configurations (dotfile) and

### Useful Working Scripts
		update.sh - You have the option to back up your date files, located 
		in your home directory (Also backups up my favorite directories from .config) 
		or restore the files inside of the dotfiles folder to your home directory.
