# Notes and Configs

Nothing special

## structure
- Notes: Hopefully, this has the links and finds that I used to help me overcome some configuration difficulty as well as notes that go into generating blog posts.
- Dotfiles: All configuration files and directories can be found in this folder.
- Scripts: Terrible scripts that need to be reworked are contained in this folder. 

## TODO
- [Configure git profiles](https://deepsource.io/blog/managing-different-git-profiles/)
